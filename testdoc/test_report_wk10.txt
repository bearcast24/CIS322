1. Creating the initial users - PASS
   No problems and the database was updated correctly
2. Test Dashboard - FAIL
   Got an Internal Server Error when trying to access the dashboard
3. Adding Facilities (2 facilities) - FAIL
   Was able to access the page, but got an Internal Server Error when trying to add a facility. Facility was not added to the database.
4. Adding assets (2 assets) - FAIL
   Was able to access the page, but got an Internal Server Error when trying to add an asset (there were a list of facilities already able to be selected, but not in the database). Asset was not added to database and asset_at table was not updated either.
5. Complete asset transit process - FAIL
   Was able to access the page, but couldn't do anything without the existence of any facilities or assets.
6. Dispose Asset - FAIL
   Page inaccessible due to the fact the @app.route line in the app.py script is commented out.
7. Asset Report - FAIL
   Was able to access the page, but report couldn't be made since there were no assets.

Although the users could be created and you can log in, dashboard doesn't work and the other pages load, but don't work.
